# MY PORTFOLIO 
I am currently enrolled in _The Tech Academy_ and am working to expand my experience in the field of software development. Even in these early stages of my education, I have learned the following languages: 
- Small basic 
- HTML 
- CSS
- And more to come!
 
Prior to entering into my pursuit to master this new craft, I had spent the last decade working in management customer service. This provided me with proficiency in problem solving, attention to detail, guest relations and team organization.
